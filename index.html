   <p id="second"> Suddenly, There's not half the files there used to be, And there's a milestone hanging over me. The system crashed so suddenly. I pushed something wrong, What it was I could not say.</p>

<div>
   <p id="third"> Now all my data's gone and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.</p>

<div>
   <p id="fourth"> The need for back-ups seemed so far away. I knew my data was all here to stay, Now I believe in yesterday.</p>
